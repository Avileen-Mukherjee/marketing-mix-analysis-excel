# Excel-Based Soda Sales Marketing Mix Modeling (MMM) Project

This project presents an end-to-end Marketing Mix Modeling (MMM) case study built entirely in Microsoft Excel. It analyzes the impact of marketing investments, pricing, promotions, and competition on monthly soda sales from January 2012 to September 2015.

The project demonstrates practical business analytics skills in Excel, without using programming tools. It is ideal for aspiring data analysts, marketing analysts, and business professionals seeking to showcase analytical thinking through real-world use cases.

### Project Objective

The core objective of this project is to quantify what drives soda sales and evaluate the effectiveness of marketing and business strategies. Key goals include estimating media effectiveness, pricing sensitivity, promotional uplift, and competitive influence using MMM frameworks and regression techniques.

### Business Questions Addressed

This project answers the following seven questions:

1. **Is there seasonality in soda sales?**  
   → Explored through pivot tables and month-wise breakdowns.

2. **Is there an overall trend in soda sales over time?**  
   → Evaluated using linear regression and moving averages.

3. **What is the relationship between media spends (TV, Radio, Digital) and sales?**  
   → Modeled using correlation, regression, and adstock transformations.

4. **How sensitive are sales to pricing changes?**  
   → Price elasticity was estimated via scatter plots and regression.

5. **Do promotions result in a significant uplift in sales?**  
   → Promo impact assessed with dummy variables and regression.

6. **Which factors explain the most variation in sales?**  
   → Multivariate regression used to combine media, price, promo, and competition.

7. **What is the effect of competitor advertising on our sales?**  
   → Evaluated through regression and partial correlation.
